# Bookmarks-keeper-Managing bookmarks is a difficult task and if you use multiple browsers then remembering on which browser you bookmarked a URL is challenging. Even if you remember a keyword present in a URL you bookmarked, you have to go through each and every bookmark on every browser to find it.


In this project we will be building a Bash Script that will fetch all the bookmarks from all the major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave Browser and Chromium) on your system and filter only those that will contain a particular word which we can provide as an argument while running the script.
